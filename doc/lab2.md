# DD2431 Machine Learning - Lab 2: SVM 
### Jun Yamada and Philipson Samuel 

## 6 Running and Reporting 
### 1
Moving the label 1 cluster to the same side, make it easier for classifier to find a descend boundary, since both clusters are completely separated. 
On the other side, the situation where the label 2 cluster is separated into 2 and located at the both sides of label 2 cluster.

### 2
put images plotted hyperplane with non-linear kernel function.

### 3 (rewrite)
If we set the parameter bigger, the smaller margin of hyperplane is chosen. 
Maximizing the margin of the hyperplane means to maximize the variance. The bigger  parameter makes the variance lower and it cause making the margin smaller.
